# Nurse-Rostering-Benchmark
Based on the data provided by the website, an integer programming model is created using Python to solve the Nurse Rostering Benchmark.

The data for this code comes from the xml file provided on the website http://www.schedulingbenchmarks.org/nrp/. 
This code uses python. Reading data and creating integer programming model are all in a complete Python file. This code has only the implementation of instance 1 and instance 2, which represents the case for a specific XML data file and generalize to all XML data files.
